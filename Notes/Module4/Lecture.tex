    \section{Logic Design}
    Logic gates are put together to create a circuit that performs an operation based on the inputs.
        \begin{itemize}\vspace{3pt}
            \item If the open-door sensor is on AND the security is armed then sound the alarm.
            \item If launch sequences 1 AND 2 AND 3 are ready OR the principal sequence is ready AND the
            rocket is fueled, then launch the rocket
        \end{itemize}
    Basic logic design using logic gates is thus far known as \texttt{combinational logic design}. As soon as the input is changed, the output is changed, and there is no \underbar{synchronization} or \underbar{clocking involved}

    \subsection*{combinational logic}
        Can have any number of inputs and outputs. These operations are defined by the logic circuits according to their design.

        \subsubsection*{Tutorial of such}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item Use a truth table to first define the behaviour
                \item How many outputs are needed
                \item What combination of inputs will make the outputs \texttt{high} or \texttt{low}
            \end{enumerate}

        \subsubsection*{Example}
            A porch lighting system uses a light sensor to detect if it is dark or light outside. It also contains a motion sensor to detect if someone walks in front of the sensor to turn on a porch light. Also
            attached to the system is a simple light switch which will turn on and off the porch light.
            \begin{center}\textbf{Operation}\end{center}
                \begin{itemize}
                    \item If it's dark outside \textbf{and} somone crosses the motion sensor, the porch light will come on
                    \item If it's light outside, the motion sensor will not turn on the porch light
                    \item Regardless of if it's light or dark outside, the light switch will turn on the porch light
                \end{itemize}

                        \item Motion sensor
                        \item switch
